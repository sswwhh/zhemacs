**What I want to achieve**
Start with a one-or-two sentence summary of what you are trying to do.

Then follow with an expanded explanation. A few suggestions of what you could
include:

+ Code or steps you've tried that did not yield the results you wanted,
+ Screenshots/casts of similar features in another editor or elsewhere,
+ Additional material or links to resources that could help clarify what you are
  trying to do.
+ A link to your private config, if it is available publicly.

**System information**
If it is pertinent to your goal, include the output of `M-x doom/info` or
`~/.emacs.d/bin/doom info` here.
